        Structured Data is used by search engines and by Google for Knowledge Graph cards. The JSON-LD format, used here, is recommended by W3C and Google.

        Note that info on Google My Business overrides data provided here.

        The following script has been tested at https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool and returns no errors or warnings.

        The format requires double quotes. Single quotes return an error.

        Note that "address" is in a set of sub-curly brackets.

One site says that the og:image should be 1200 pixelsx627 pixels (1.91/1 ratio). Don't exceed 5MB.

Use Facebook's Open Graph Object Debugger.

    https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/opengraph/object-type/restaurant.restaurant/

    http://ogp.me/

    http://ogp.me/ns/ogp.me.ttl


    Add and determine object type by choosing the tag which best describes whether it is a website, personal portfolio, author, book, restaurant, blog or blog article, etc:
<meta property="og:type" content="Website type" />
Currently available objects are the following: (website, article, book, books.author, books.genre, business.business, fitness.course, music.album, music.musician, music.playlist, music.radio_station, music.song, object, place, product, product.group, product.item, profile, quick_election.election, restaurant, restaurant.menu, restaurant.menu_item, restaurant.menu_section, video.episode, video.movie, video.tv_show, video.other).
*There may be some changes in the existing or adding new object attributes due to constant development of the Open Graph Protocol.


9. The last, but not the least, is adding the ID of a private Facebook profile’s administrator number from which the Facebook page of the company was created:
<meta property="fb:admins" content="Facebook admin Id number" />
or adding the ID number of the Facebook application which was created from the administrator’s Facebook account:
<meta property="fb:app_id" content="Facebook application Id number" />
