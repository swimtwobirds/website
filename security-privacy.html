        <p>1. Browsing Our Website<br>
        
        When you visit our website, you do so over an encrypted connection. This is why our internet address starts with https://, and why you see a padlock or key symbol in your browser bar. If you click on the padlock or key, you will find information about our security certificate and encryption.</p>
        
        <p>2. Making a Reservation<br>

ResDiary's website is at https://resdiary.com.</p>
        
            <p>We keep records of our reservations in order to improve our retaurant and our service to customers.</p>
        
        <p>3. Subscribing to Our Newsletter<br>
        
        We write a newsletter about our restaurant, specials and upcoming events. You can subscribe by filling out a form on our website. The form asks for your name and e-mail address.
